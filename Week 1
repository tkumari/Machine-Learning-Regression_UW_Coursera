# Intro 

This week covers the introduction to the course & basics of Linear Regression. Regression allows us to make predictions from data by learning the relationship between features of your data and some observed continuous-valued response. 
Simple Linear Regression
-	Fitting a line to the data to make predictions from a simple, univariate feature of the data.  e.g.  predicting house prices based on their square-feet area
Data :  y(i)=w0 + w1 x(i) + e(i)
Model: f(x)=w0 + w1 x
