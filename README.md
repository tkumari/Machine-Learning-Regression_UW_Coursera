# Overview of the Course

The assignments in this course used a house sales dataset from Kings County where Seattle is located. It gave me hands on experience on learning various methods used in making predictions about the data using GraphLab Create and numpy in IPython notebook.

Summary of what I learnt from this course:

Models 
•	Linear regression
•	Regularization : Ridge(L2), Lasso (L1)
•	Nearest Neighbor & Kernel Regression

Algorithms:
•	Gradient descent
•	Coordinate descent

Concepts:
•	Loss functions
•	Bias-variance tradeoff
•	Cross validation
•	Sparsity
•	Overfitting 
•	Model selection 
•	Feature selection
